Original data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)
	Source Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Original data were downloazed then unzipped using mictosoft windows 10.  Further information on this dataset is available in the README file contained in the downloaded .zip file.

For these analysis, averaged testing and training data from this dataset were used (X_train.txt and X_test.txt).  Information on the mean and standard deviation were extracted and a summary table constructed for each participant over each activity for each movement measure.

mean_SD_data contains the mean and standard deviation information from the original dataset.

Column names (mean_SD_data) corresponding gyroscope and accelarometer readings during eachf activity are as follows:

Files
run_analysis.R
	r script used for the analysis

other files
	from the original dataset (see original readme below)


#data generated in run_analysis.R
mean_SD_data
	 contains the mean and standard deviation information from the original dataset.

SummaryMeans
	Contains the mean of each column (movement standard deviation and mean) for each subject and activity (6 trials)
	Column names and factor names are the same as for the mean_SD_data table

===================================================================

Factor variables
	Factor columns:
		subjects
			number of the subject performing the activity
				subject1 through subject30

		activity
			name of activity being performed during measurements (six trials per subject)
				WALKING
           			WALKING_UPSTAIRS
				WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
				SITTING            
				STANDING         
				LAYING

	movement columns:
		contain mean and standard deviation data for each movement from original dataset.
